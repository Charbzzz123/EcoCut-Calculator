# EcoCut Calculator – Technical Documentation

## Overview
EcoCut Calculator is a full-stack workspace composed of:
- **Angular 21 SPA** in the repo root (`src/`) that delivers the calculator experience.
- **NestJS API** scaffold inside `/server` (currently placeholder) reserved for future persistence/integrations.

The frontend is deployed as a static site (NG build output), while the backend will expose REST/GraphQL endpoints when activated.

## Repository Layout
```

```

## Frontend Architecture
- **Entry Point:** `src/main.ts` bootstraps the standalone `App` component defined in `src/app/app.ts`.
- **Component Style:** Standalone components + Angular Signals. Routing is configured via `src/app/app.routes.ts` (empty for now).
- **Styling:** Global styles in `src/styles.scss`, component-level SCSS via `styleUrl` references.
- **Build:** `@angular/build:application` (esbuild + Vite dev server) configured in `angular.json`.
- **State:** Currently a single `title` signal; expand using dedicated state services/signals modules as features grow.

### Entry Modal Implementation
- **Component**: `src/app/home/components/entry-modal/entry-modal.component.ts` renders the warm lead / customer modal. It uses `NonNullableFormBuilder`, Angular signals for per-hedge state, and an anchored detail panel that moves based on the clicked polygon’s bounding box.
- **SVG / Assets**: The hedge planner background lives in `public/assets/warm-lead/a_bird_s_eye_view_digital_illustration_showcases_a.png`. Each hedge polygon is defined in the component template (`hedge-1`…`hedge-8`). A README in that folder explains how to swap in the branded art.
- **State machine**:
  - Signals (`hedgeStates`, `savedConfigs`, `panelState`, etc.) keep the component reactive without services.
  - `cycleHedge` toggles `None → Trim → Rabattage → None`, rehydrates saved configs, and clamps the contextual panel position inside the SVG container.
  - Trim configs capture either combinable sections (inside/top/outside) or presets, while Rabattage configs capture option + optional partial text.
- **Testing/coverage**: `src/app/home/components/entry-modal/entry-modal.component.spec.ts` holds 22 focused specs that exercise DOM interactions, state hydration, validations, and template bindings. Run `npx ng test --watch=false --coverage` to enforce the repo’s “100% every file” rule (Husky hooks also run this before commits).
- **Integration**: `HomeShellComponent` imports the modal and toggles it from the floating “Add Entry” CTA. The component emits `EntryModalPayload` with the selected variant, normalized form payload, and hedge configs, which will later feed the façade/server.

## Backend Services
- `/server` hosts the NestJS 11 API (ESM). It now contains a **Google Calendar integration** for pushing EcoCut jobs/events.
- REST endpoints (documented in `server/README.md`):
  - `POST /calendar/events` – create an event with summary/description/start/end/timezone/attendees.
  - `DELETE /calendar/events/:eventId` – remove a previously created event.
- **Environment variables**
  | Name | Required | Purpose |
  | ---- | -------- | ------- |
  | `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CREDENTIALS_PATH` *or* `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CREDENTIALS` | Yes | Points to / contains the service-account JSON for `ecocut-calendar-bot@ecocut-calendar-link.iam.gserviceaccount.com`. JSON files live outside the repo. |
  | `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID` | Optional | Overrides the default target calendar (`ecojcut@gmail.com`). |
- Failure to provide credentials disables the calendar module gracefully but the endpoints will throw a clear error—set env vars before local dev or deployments.
- Always run backend scripts from `server/` (`npm run start:dev`, `npm run test`, etc.) so node_modules stay isolated.

## Tooling & Commands
| Purpose        | Frontend Command            | Notes |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | ----- |
| Install deps   | `npm ci`                    | Use `npm.cmd` if execution policy blocks scripts. |
| Dev server     | `npm start`                 | Opens http://localhost:4200/ |
| Build          | `npm run build`             | Outputs to `dist/ecocut-calculator` |
| Unit tests     | `npm run test`              | Launches Angular/Vitest suite (coverage auto-opens). |
| Lint           | `npm run lint`              | Angular ESLint configuration. |

## Environments
- **Local:** Angular dev server, optional Nest dev server once implemented.
- **Preview (TBD):** Configure via CI/CD (GitHub Actions + Vercel/Netlify) to auto-build pull requests.
- **Production (TBD):** Upload built assets to CDN or static hosting; connect to managed backend service once ready.

## Documentation Workflow
1. Update `docs/general-instructions.md` when rules/processes change.
2. Update `docs/app-functionality.md` whenever features are added/modified.
3. Use this file for architectural notes, environment configs, data flows, and onboarding steps.
4. Reference the README only for the elevator pitch; keep detailed material here.

## Next Steps
- Replace placeholder Angular template with real calculator components.
- Flesh out server requirements and link to front end via API clients.
- Automate documentation publishing (Docs site or wiki) once scope grows.

## Branding & Theming
- **Design tokens** live in src/styles/theme.scss; src/styles.scss simply consumes those variables so tokens stay centralized.
- **Dark evergreen palette** keeps the UI in sync with the EcoCut brand (deep greens, neon growth accents).
- **Brand assets** belong in public/assets/brand/. Expected files: eco-logo.png (wordmark) and eco-mascot.png (character). A placeholder SVG loads if the mascot file is absent.
